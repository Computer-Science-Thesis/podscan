1. Remove Infected Pods Immediately: Carefully remove and destroy all infected pods, including small or early-stage ones.
2. Do not drop them on the ground or leave them under the tree, as they can still spread disease.
3. Sanitize the Area Under the Tree: Clean up and dispose of any fallen, infected pods or debris under the tree. Keep the base of the tree clear to minimize disease sources and reduce re-infection risks.
4. Use Fungicides as Needed: You may apply systemic fungicides (e.g., Difenoconazole) to affected trees and surrounding plants.
5. Sanitize Tools and Hands: Disinfect pruning tools, gloves, and any equipment used during removal. Clean hands between handling different trees, especially if working manually.
6. Increase Monitoring: Check the infected tree and nearby ones two to three times a week to catch any new signs early.
7. Improve Air Circulation: Trim nearby vegetation or branches to reduce humidity and limit fungal growth.
===
1. Remove Infected Pods Right Away: Take out any infected pods, even the smaller or early-stage ones, and destroy them.
2. Don’t Leave Pods on the Ground: Don’t let infected pods fall to the ground or stay under the tree—they can spread disease.
3. Clean the Area Around the Tree: Get rid of any fallen pods or debris under the tree to keep things clean and prevent re-infection.
4. Use Fungicides When Needed: If necessary, apply systemic fungicides (like Difenoconazole) to the affected tree and surrounding plants.
5. Sanitize Your Tools and Hands: Always clean your pruning tools, gloves, and hands after handling infected trees to avoid spreading the disease.
6. Check Trees Regularly: Inspect the infected tree and nearby ones a couple of times a week for new signs.
7. Improve Airflow: Trim surrounding plants or branches to let air flow better and help reduce fungal growth.
===
1. Remove Infected Pods Immediately: Carefully take out and destroy any infected pods, including the small ones or those in early stages.
2. Don’t Leave Pods on the Ground: Avoid dropping infected pods on the ground or leaving them under the tree—they can still spread the disease.
3. Clean Up the Tree Area: Make sure to remove any fallen infected pods or debris beneath the tree to keep things clean and avoid further infection.
4. Consider Fungicide: If needed, apply fungicides like Difenoconazole to the affected trees and nearby plants.
5. Sanitize Equipment and Hands: Always disinfect your tools, gloves, and hands to prevent spreading disease between trees.
6. Monitor Trees Often: Check the infected tree and its neighbors a few times a week to spot any new issues.
7. Improve Airflow: Trim back nearby plants or branches to help with air circulation and reduce moisture that could lead to fungus.
===
1. Remove Infected Pods Right Away: Get rid of any infected pods, including smaller ones or those that are still developing.
2. Don’t Leave Infected Pods on the Ground: Don’t let them fall to the ground or sit under the tree, as they can spread the disease.
3. Clean Under the Tree: Clear out any fallen, infected pods or debris around the base of the tree to reduce the risk of re-infection.
4. Apply Fungicide When Needed: If necessary, apply fungicides like Difenoconazole to the affected tree and surrounding plants.
5. Sanitize Tools and Hands: Disinfect your pruning tools, gloves, and hands to stop disease from spreading.
6. Increase Inspections: Keep a close eye on the infected tree and nearby trees at least two or three times a week for new signs.
7. Boost Airflow: Trim any nearby vegetation or branches to help reduce humidity and discourage fungal growth.

1. Get Rid of Infected Pods Right Away: Carefully remove all infected pods, including any that are small or still developing.
2. Don’t Let Pods Fall to the Ground: If you remove any infected pods, don’t let them drop on the ground or sit under the tree—this can spread the disease.
3. Clean Around the Tree: Clear out any infected pods or debris from beneath the tree to minimize the spread of infection.
4. Use Fungicides When Necessary: Consider applying systemic fungicides like Difenoconazole to the affected tree and surrounding plants.
5. Sanitize Your Gear: Always clean your tools, gloves, and hands after handling infected trees to prevent spreading the disease.
6. Check the Trees Regularly: Inspect the affected tree and neighboring trees a few times a week to catch any new problems early.
7. Improve Airflow: Trim nearby branches or plants to improve circulation and reduce moisture buildup, which can encourage fungal growth.
